# Introduction to Security

One benefit of managing devices with Intune is that it gives you control of security features across the devices it manages and allows IT admins the ability to fine-tune their environments to meet their security and compliance needs. There are several methods available such as security baselines, defender for endpoint, compliance policies, conditional access, etc. that can be used to our benefit.

Every organization will have different concerns when it comes to data governance, risk, compliance, regulation, and other requirements make demands on how things can be structured. Since there is no one-size-fits-all solution to security, this section is meant as more of a walkthrough of options available within Intune rather than a comprehensive list of air-tight security measures. As always with security, consider your own threat model and how it applies to the resources available. 

# Security Baselines

Conveniently, Microsoft created a way for administrators to change granular security settings that can be saved as templates called Security Baselines. 

To access Security Baselines just go to `Intune > Endpoint security > Security Baselines > Security Baseline for Windows 10 and later > Create policy`. Most of the recommended defaults Microsoft gives us are pretty good so generally it is good enough to keep what is already in there but this would be the place to go for granular changes. 

- **Name**: Windows 11 Baseline
- **Description**: Windows 11 Baseline
- **Configuration Settings**: Keep Defaults
- **Assignments**: All-Employees and All-Windows-11

Once you save this baseline the security settings chosen in Configuration Settings will be enforced on all users and Windows 11 devices. If we wanted to tweak these settings later on we could come back and change the settings or possibly create a new baseline and assign it to a different group of users or devices. 

We could also consider, for testing purposes, limiting the rollout of this Security Baseline to our IT pilot users similar to howe we did with the Update Rings. This way we could ensure the baseline works correctly for non-critical users before pushing it out to all users.

# Defender for Endpoint

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint can be used as an Endpoint Detection and Response solution within your environment. You can create policies with Intune that onboard MDE to each device so you have visibility into the security of your devices. 

Now go to `Defender > Settings > Endpoints > Onboarding` where you can find the download button for the Onboarding package. Make sure to select "Mobile Device Management / Microsoft Intune" from the Deployment method dropdown first.

Clicking download will get you a file called `WindowsDefenderATP.onboarding` that can be uploaded into the Intune Portal. 

To create a new onboarding policy go to `Intune > Endpoint security > Endpoint detection and response > Create policy`

>On this page Intune will also show you how many devices you currently do not have onboarded.

Now you will need to get the text from within the `WindowsDefenderATP.onboarding` file which Microsoft calls the Onboarding blob. You can open it in something standard like Notepad or VSCode and paste the entire thing in the field called Onboarding (Device) below. In the Create Profile wizard I added the following settings:

- **Platform**: Windows
- **Profile**: Endpoint Detection and Response
- **Name**: EDR Onboarding
- **Description**: EDR Onboarding
- **Microsoft Defender for Endpoint client configuration package type**: Onboarding
- **Onboarding (Device)**: Onboarding blob
- **Sample Sharing**: All (Default)
- **Assignment**: All-Windows-11 Include

It took some time for the settings to sync but after a bit I came back and saw I had one onboarded device and two successful device checkins.

This means that Intune is successfully connected to MDE and onboarded to the EDR. Intune is now able to push security profiles to devices it manages as well as pull status reports from them. 

# Compliance Policies

Compliance policies in Intune can be used as a way to enforce that certain security features are required on devices assigned to the policy. For instance you can require devices use BitLocker and Secure Boot to be marked compliant.
