Now that we have gotten a lot of the initial foundation done we have a place to build our lab environment in. On this page I am going to walk through setting up Windows in our lab environment. I am going to start with a Windows Server 2025 VM, promote it to domain controller, and join a Windows 11 workstation machine to it to simulate a small office environment. Later on I will install network sensors and feed logs up into a SIEM so we can do some real security stuff.
