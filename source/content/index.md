This is where I document my Lab Setups and other How-To's. Hopefully you find something here useful. 

Currently I'm working on a Microsoft Intune lab to test deployment configurations of Windows 11 machines. Its fun to see a newly setup VM be able to push through a standardized fresh install based on organizational requirements, all just by the user entering their Microsoft Entra login credentials. 

In theory, an IT team could then ship a brand new laptop straight to a newly hired remote employee and the employee could get themselves up and running within an hour with an automatic install.
